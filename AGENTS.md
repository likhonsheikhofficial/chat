# Powerful AI Agent

This document describes the design and setup for a **Powerful AI Agent** built using the **AI SDK**, **AI Elements**, and **shadcn/ui**. This agent is capable of autonomous reasoning, task execution, code generation, conversation management, and AI-native interface rendering.

---

## Overview

The AI Agent is a **modular, extensible system** that integrates:

- **AI SDK Core** – Unified API for text generation, structured objects, tool calls, and agent orchestration.
- **AI SDK UI** – Framework-agnostic hooks for building chat and generative interfaces.
- **AI Elements** – Pre-built React components for AI applications (messages, conversations, reasoning, code blocks, image previews, etc.).

The agent can run in a **Next.js environment** with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (CSS Variables mode), and shadcn/ui integration.

## Capabilities

- **Autonomous Task Execution:** Breaks down complex tasks into actionable steps.
- **Conversation Management:** Handles multiple chat threads and context-aware dialogue.
- **Code Generation & Reasoning:** Displays AI reasoning, code blocks, and structured outputs.
- **Tool Integration:** Calls external APIs or internal tools as needed.
- **AI Content Rendering:** Renders messages, prompts, images, inline citations, and web previews.
- **Task Tracking:** Supports suggestions, task status, and completion visualization.
